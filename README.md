# learning android-basics-in-java

i'm using one of TheNewBoston (btw, super cool YouTuber!) older tutorials to learn: 
# The fundamentals of android development in Java.

(will probably switch to learning android in kotlin... :)
but This tutorial is also indirectly helping my efforts of learning java even better too!

// two birds with one stones right :)
