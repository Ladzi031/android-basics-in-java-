# learning android-basics-in-java

i'm using one of TheNewBoston (btw, super cool YouTuber!) OLDER tutorials to learn: 
# The fundamentals of android development in Java.

(will probably switch to learning android in kotlin... :)
but This tutorial is also helping my efforts of learning java even better!
