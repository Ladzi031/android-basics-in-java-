# Computer Lab Assets calculator
 A sample app that calculates the total cost of eletronics in a computer lab...

 It has Three OutlinedTextFiled, that accepts a Number as input
 one for the NumberOfComputers
 another for the NumberOfKeyboards
 and the last one for the NumberOfScreens
 and based of that it shows the total cost of assets in that specific room

 nothing too serious, the goal here was to learn more about jet-Pack compose!
 # some jet-Pack concepts learned here are:

 - Recomposition
 - remember property delegate
 - mutableStateOf and basics concepts of observable
 - state-hoisting design pattern
 - button
